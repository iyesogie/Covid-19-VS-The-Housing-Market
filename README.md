	Over the last year we have experienced a vast amount of change. From the way we go to the grocery store to the expanding world of remote work/school. One aspect of our society that will surely see change is the housing market. In 2008 we witnessed the collapse of the housing market because of the stock market crash. Many feared the same would occur with the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, with the rise of unemployment. As the pandemic has continued, we have seen interest rates drop and the price of homes increase. So, the question that arises is ÒWhat effect, if any, will the pandemic have in the coming years?Ó.
 
Original Questions 
1. With the onset of the pandemic many individuals lost their income due to many business closings to maintain the lock down orders that were imposed. How did this affect the housing market? 
2. ÊWith big money purchases like cars, homes also going down. The government used interest rate to motivate people to spend money, as it is now better to purchase a house or a car because the mortgage or auto loan payments will be less due to lower interest rate.Ê
3. Is it true that individuals with bachelors and graduate degrees tend to buy more houses and apartments than individuals without bachelors and graduate degrees?
4. As the pandemic took its toll on the economy, we saw a significant increase in unemployment in 2020. What toll did this have on the market?

The pivot 

As the we explored the data, we came across many roadblocks. The data that was retrieved could not accurately answer the questions posed. So, we devised a set on new questions that the data could better answer. 

1. What is the relationship between the number of covid test administered and the number of confirmed cases/deaths?
2. what is the relationship between the initial number of unemployment case and the the number of tests?
3. What is the relationship between the number of hospitalizations and the continued unemployment claims?
4. What is the relationship between the number of initial unemployment claims, the continued claims and the unemployment rate? 

The findings 
1. What is the relationship between the number of covid test administered and the number of confirmed cases/deaths?
      There was significantly more test administered than confirmed cases and deaths, especially during the last quarter of 2020. Then we see a dramatic drop in the number of tests administered in the first quarter of 2021
2. what is the relationship between the initial number of unemployment case and the number of tests?
      As the pandemic began, we saw a large amount on initial unemployment case, however there we had far fewer test administered. Then we see a swap as the number of tests increased the number of initial unemployment claims decreased.
3. What is the relationship between the number of hospitalizations and the continued unemployment claims?
      Throughout the pandemic there has been steady number of hospitalizations. However, we can see a spike in the months that had fewer continued cases 
4. What is the relationship between the number of initial unemployment claims, the continued claims, and the unemployment rate? 
      The initial claims and continued claims have pretty much mirrored each other, causing the unemployment rate to do same.
